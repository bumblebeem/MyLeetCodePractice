//There is no trick for this problem. Some people used slow/fast pointers to find the tail node,
//but I don't see the benefit (in the sense that it doesn't reduce the pointer move op) to do so. 
//So I just used one loop to find the length first.


//It's fairly easy to come up with the two-pointer solution first though...
