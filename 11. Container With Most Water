//The proof in the above link is great!

//The basic idea is starting by evaluating the widest container, using the first and the last line. 
//*All other possible containers are less wide, so to hold more water, they need to be higher.* 
//Thus, after evaluating that widest container, skip lines at both ends that don't support a higher height. 
//Then evaluate that new container we arrived at. Repeat until there are no more possible containers left.
