//The idea is: I calculated the stored water at each index a and b in my code. 
//At the start of every loop, I update the current maximum height from left side (that is from A[0,1...a]) 
//and the maximum height from right side(from A[b,b+1...n-1]). if(leftmax<rightmax) then, 
//at least (leftmax-A[a]) water can definitely be stored no matter what happens between [a,b], 
//since we know there is a barrier at the rightside(rightmax>leftmax). On the other side, 
//we cannot store more water than (leftmax-A[a]) at index a since the barrier at left is of height leftmax. 
//So, we know the water that can be stored at index a is exactly (leftmax-A[a]). 
//The same logic applies to the case when (leftmax>rightmax). At each loop we can make a and b one step closer. 
//Thus we can finish it in linear time.
